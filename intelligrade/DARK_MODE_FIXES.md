# Dark Mode Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **StudentDashboard Dark Mode Initialization**
   - Added `initializeDarkMode()` method to StudentDashboard.vue
   - Called dark mode initialization in `mounted()` lifecycle
   - Now properly respects saved dark mode preference on dashboard load

2. **Removed Local CSS Variable Overrides**
   - Removed duplicate `:root` variable declarations from Settings.vue
   - Removed conflicting `:root.dark` styles in Settings.vue
   - All components now use global CSS variables from main.css

3. **Enhanced Global CSS Variables**
   - Added error and success message variables to main.css
   - Light mode: `--error-bg`, `--error-color`, `--success-bg`, `--success-color`
   - Dark mode: Updated colors for better contrast in dark theme

4. **Updated Settings Component**
   - Error and success messages now use CSS variables
   - Properly adapts to both light and dark themes

## How Dark Mode Works Now:

1. Settings.vue toggles dark mode and saves to localStorage
2. StudentDashboard.vue initializes dark mode on mount from localStorage
3. All components use global CSS variables that adapt to light/dark theme
4. Theme persists across page refreshes and navigation

## Testing:

1. Navigate to Settings and toggle Dark Mode
2. Refresh the page - dark mode should persist
3. Navigate between different student dashboard sections
4. All sections should maintain the same dark mode appearance
